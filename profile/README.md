## Overview

This project addresses the need for automatic documentation generation for backend development projects, specifically those built with Django. The proposal focuses on creating a tool that integrates with the GitHub API, allowing users to select a specific Django project and automatically generate reference guides. These technical guides aim to provide developers with a clear and quick understanding of how a particular API functions.

### Problem Statement

This project was initiated in response to three main issues:
1. **Lack of Documentation**: Often due to time constraints, developers do not document their projects adequately.
2. **Perception of Documentation**: Documentation is frequently viewed as a non-priority task, leading to its neglect within organizations.
3. **Organizational Culture**: Many organizations rely solely on developers' tacit knowledge without promoting the creation of technical documentation. This is risky as any developer might leave the project at any time.

By automating the documentation process, this project aims to improve the understanding and maintenance of APIs, thereby facilitating better project management and developer onboarding.
